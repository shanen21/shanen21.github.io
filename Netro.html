            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>
				Penang's success in attracting economic growth has led to challenges such as land scarcity and congestion, particularly in George Town and Bayan Lepas. Despite efforts to open industrial zones on the mainland, the state still faces issues like traffic congestion and reduced liveability. To revive the economy and create jobs, especially amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Penang aims to implement a long-term stimulus package that includes reclaiming land in Penang South Island. 
            </p>
            <p>
				Penang South Island (PSI) - now known as Silicon Island - is the green city of the future. It is an 2,300-acre island development project over the next 10 to 15 years, and it will be one of the key enabling strategies towards fulfilling the Penang State's vision â€“ a World-Class Tourist Destination, a Green Technology Park for knowledge workers, and a project with Smart City Planning addressing Environmental Sustainability. 
				Penang Silicon Island also embraces global sustainability standards, incorporating UN SDGs, ESG principles, Low Carbon Cities Framework recommendations, and Penang2030 vision, focusing on family-centric development.
            </p>
            <p>
				Silicon Island is located south of the Penang Island, strategically situated near key infrastructures including Penang International Airport, the Second Penang Bridge, and the Bayan Lepas free industrial zone. Its proximity to educational institutions like Universiti Sains Malaysia, research centers like CREST, and skill development centers like PSDC aims to foster innovation and collaboration.
